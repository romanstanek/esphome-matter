Almost all device types can be created in esphome-matter. But some require extra configuration to be created correctly. However, creating a device type only allows other Matter devices to interact with these device types. It doesn't automatically mean that ESPHome can do anything useful with the clusters the device type creates yet.

Here is a list of all device types that are currently known to work and what functionality is supported.

# Lights

The Matter light device types are `on_off_light`, `dimmable_light`, `color_temperature_light`, and `extended_color_light`. Each adds more functionality to the previous device type.

All of the light device types can be created, but currently only the on/off feature is working.

```yaml
matter:
  endpoints:
    1:
      on_off_light:
        light_id: light_id
    2:
      dimmable_light:
        light_id: light_id
    3:
      color_temperature_light:
        light_id: light_id
    4:
      extended_color_light:
        light_id: light_id
```

# Switches

The Matter switch device types are `on_off_light_switch`, `dimmer_switch` and `color_dimmer_switch`. Instead of mapping an esphome entity to the switch device type, esphome actions are mapped to the endpoint on which the switch is created.

```yaml
matter:
  endpoints:
    1:
      on_off_light_switch:
    2:
      id: dimmer_endpoint
      dimmer_switch:
    3:
      color_dimmer_switch:

switch:
  - name: "Up Button"
    on_click:
      matter.on_off.on: dimmer_endpoint
    on_press:
      matter.level_control.move_with_on_off:
        endpoint_id: dimmer_endpoint
        move_mode: up
        rate: 20%/s
    on_release:
      matter.level_control.stop_with_on_off: dimmer_endpoint
```

For a complete overview of supported actions, see the documentation on [actions](actions.md).

# Simple sensor device types

The "simple" sensor device types are `Temperature Sensor`, `Humidity Sensor`, `Light Sensor`, `Pressure Sensor`, `Flow Sensor`. These all have a similar structure where they expose a measurement cluster with a `MeasuredValue` attribute. These clusters also have the `MinMeasureValue`, `MaxMeasuredValue` and optional `Tolerance` attributes but these aren't supported yet.

```yaml
matter:
  endpoints:
    1:
      temperature_sensor:
        temperature: sensor_id
    2:
      humidity_sensor:
        relative_humidity: sensor_id
    3:
      # The light_sensor also LightSensorType attribute, but setting this attribute isn't supported yet.
      light_sensor:
        illuminance: sensor_id
    4:
      # The pressure_sensor has the `Extended` feature that enables some more attributes, but this isn't supported yet.
      pressure_sensor:
        pressure: sensor_id
    5:
      flow_sensor:
        flow: sensor_id
```

# Binary sensors

There are several binary state sensors. These are `contact_sensor`, `occupancy_sensor`, `rain_sensor`, `soil_sensor`. Unlike the simple sensors, these sensors all expose the same boolean_state cluster.

```yaml
matter:
  endpoints:
    1:
      contact_sensor:
        boolean_state: binary_sensor_id
    2:
      occupancy_sensor:
        boolean_state: binary_sensor_id
    3:
      soil_sensor:
        boolean_state: binary_sensor_id
    4:
      occupancy_sensor:
        boolean_state: binary_sensor_id
```

# air_quality_sensor

The `Air Quality Sensor` supports many concentration measurements as well as temperature and humidity. Each measurement gets its own cluster. These clusters are only created when a sensor_id is mapped to that measurement cluster.

```yaml
matter:
  endpoints:
    1:
      air_quality_sensor:
        temperature: temperature_id
        relative_humidity: humidity_id
        carbon_monoxide: co_id
        carbon_dioxide: co2_id
        nitrogen_dioxide: no2_id
        ozone: ozone_id
        pm_1: pm_1_id
        pm_2_5: pm_2_5_id
        pm_10: pm_10_id
        formaldehyde: formaldehyde_id
        total_voc: total_voc_id
        radon: radon_id
```

# electrical_sensor

This device type exposes clusters and attributes for power and energy measurements. However, this device type currently can't successfully be created in esphome-matter yet.

# generic_switch (single button)

Map a debounced ESPHome binary sensor to a Matter momentary button:

```yaml
matter:
  endpoints:
    2:
      generic_switch:
        binary_sensor: test_button
```

The mapping enables MomentarySwitch, MomentarySwitchRelease,
MomentarySwitchLongPress, and MomentarySwitchMultiPress (maximum 2).
The binary sensor must report true for pressed; configure inversion and debounce
on that sensor. The current position is 1 when pressed and 0 when released.
Initial state synchronization does not emit an event. A button held during
startup must be released before a complete click can be reported.

- Single click: InitialPress, ShortRelease, then MultiPressComplete(1) after
  350 ms without another press.
- Double click: a second press within that window emits MultiPressOngoing(2),
  then MultiPressComplete(2) 350 ms after the second release.
- Long press: holding the first press for 800 ms emits LongPress once, followed
  by LongRelease on release. It does not emit a single-click completion.
- A hold on a later press belongs to the multi-press sequence and does not
  generate long-press events. More than two presses reports completion count 0
  (overflow), rather than a false double click.

Controllers should use MultiPressComplete to distinguish single and double
clicks, rather than triggering single-click actions on InitialPress or
ShortRelease. Controller behavior must be verified after the feature-map update.
Action-switch and latching features are rejected. Timers run on ESPHome's main
loop and event updates run on the Matter thread.

The Waveshare P4 Ethernet example retains temperature endpoint 1 and adds button
endpoint 2. With power disconnected, connect a normally-open dry-contact button
between the header pins labelled GPIO2 and GND. Do not connect the button to a
power rail. A four-leg tactile switch has internally joined pairs: choose one
terminal from each pair (verify with a continuity meter if uncertain).
GPIO2 is shown in the [official board pinout](https://docs.waveshare.com/assets/images/ESP32-P4-Module-DEV-KIT-details-intro-0c4dab98d7d37956d9339e02b96f6011.webp).
The example uses an internal pull-up and 30 ms debounce on both edges.

After flashing, check for `InitialPress` and `ShortRelease` under `matter.switch`
in the serial log, then verify an event for each click in the Matter controller.
Repeated clicks must remain distinct even when the final position is unchanged.

On 2026-09-16, this configuration compiled and ran on the Waveshare ESP32-P4
revision 1.0 board. Serial logs confirmed repeated InitialPress/ShortRelease
pairs on endpoint 2 and retained both existing Matter fabrics. The user verified
that single press switched lights through Apple Home and subsequently confirmed
double press and long press work there too. All three gestures have therefore
been user-verified in Apple Home. Home Assistant has not yet been tested.
